python multithreading
CPython implementation detail: In CPython, due to the Global Interpreter Lock, 
only one thread can execute Python code at once (even though certain performance-oriented 
libraries might overcome this limitation). If you want your application to make better use of 
the computational resources of multi-core machines, you are advised to use multiprocessing or 
concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor. However, threading is still an appropriate model 
if you want to run multiple I/O-bound tasks simultaneously.
